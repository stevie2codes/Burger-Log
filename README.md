## Functionality
Enter a burger you would like to eat! The users input will be **created** and saved to a **Mysql database** and remain on page even after page reload. The users choice will populate via **handlebars** and you can then click the devour button and your burger will then **UPDATE** into the devoured section.  Then you can **DELETE** your burger wich will dynamically delete your choice from the database. Devour as many burgers as you'd like guilt free! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
